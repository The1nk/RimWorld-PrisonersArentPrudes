# Prisoners Aren't Prudes

When a pawn ges arrested, all of their apparel will now be unlocked. In vanilla, the apparel only becomes unlcoked when they're **recruited** or when their apparel's durability drops below 50%. Arresting refugees, guests, praetors, etc wouldn't let you get at their gear .. this fixes that.
